# CPSC6119-Term-Project

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a real-world application using object-oriented design techniques exposed in this class. Your task is to implement a software that implements a software solution to the real-world problem. The software can be implemented either in Java, or C#. Other programming languages will NOT be accepted.

## Requirements of the project:
- The project can be developed individually or by a group of at most two students
- You must use the Strategy Pattern, the Observer Pattern and a 3rd design pattern of your choice to design your project (more than 3 design patterns can be used in your design)
- You must develop a class diagram for your project. The class diagram MUST be drawn using standard UML notations and submitted as a PDF or PNG.
- All the output of your program MUST be stored in databases or files. Inputs can also be read from databases or files.
- An extra credit of 5 points will be given to use GUIs for all user interactions.


## Proposal
Zubway is a local sandwich store that has difficulties in taking orders from its customers. They write orders on paper which takes time, making the process ineffective. This problem is making them lose clients due to long waiting times. Zubway is trying to develop a sandwich ordering system for their store. The Ordering System will have GUIs for users to take orders intuitively and conveniently. Observer Pattern will be applied to this application for listening to user’s input (mouse clicks) and performing corresponding logic under the hood. The Strategy pattern will also be used to substitute the bread toasting behavior (not toasted, lightly toasted, and heavily toasted) at runtime. Those toasted behaviors are interchangeable according to the user’s choice. Last but not least, the Decorator pattern will also be applied to this system because the users can choose any kind of cheese, meat, veggies, and seasoning accordingly. Some other design patterns might also be used in this project based on the needs.
The system will have the functionality to show the customers all cheese, meat, veggies, and seasoning options menu as the user goes through the sandwich-making process. The system will be able to calculate the total price for the customized sandwich, as well as print out the options that the customer has chosen. The system will be designed and implemented carefully using object-oriented design principles and patterns to guarantee the maintenance and flexibility of the system. Meanwhile, the system will be easily be adapted as another ordering system for other stores as the requirement changes because the object-oriented principles ensure that.
